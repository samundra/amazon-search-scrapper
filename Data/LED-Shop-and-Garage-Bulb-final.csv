High efficiency LED light with 6ft power cord. Great for use in kitchens, living rooms, garages, shops, under counters, basements, utility rooms, closets, laundry rooms and more! Made from durable heavy gauge aluminium. 


Our 3ft fixture has the light output equivalent to over 3 - 60 watt incandescent light bulbs while only using 26 watts of power!


High brightness, efficient smooth flowing light, no harsh pinpoints.


*High efficiency - Real 100+ lumens/watt
 Other LED fixtures are rated as LED Lumens/watt which does not include the losses in the power supply which can be as high as 30%. That loss is generated as heat which reduces the overall efficiency. We use high efficacy LED's AND high efficiency power supplies which allows our Professional Series lights to equal or surpass the 100 lumen/watt rating as a whole. 


*4500k Color Temp
 Closer to daylight than regular warm white incandescent and fluorescent bulbs with no harsh blue tint. Instant on full brightness, no warmup needed. 


*Linkable up to 6 lights with no gaps in between
 Each light comes with an interconnect to daisy chain up to 6 units end to end and power them all with only one power cord. 


*Better heat dissipation
 High temperatures will make LEDs fail prematurely, that's why the Professional Series lights have all the LEDs soldered directly to a rigid aluminium circuit board, no cheap LED tape here. The circuit board is then bonded to an extra thick 16 gauge aluminium heat sink. This design allows efficient removal of heat away from the LEDs for longer life."

They can be installed permanently or temporarily as they are completely self contained light fixtures that operate on 110v or 220v circuits. 

 The most outstanding traits of LED lighting its ability to operate using half the power of florescent lights and 1/7th the power of incandescent lights to create the same amount of light making these the most power saving and eco-friendly lights on the market. 

 The life of LED lighting is another great feature over florescent and incandescent lighting. LEDs have an increased average lifespan of 50,000+ hours compared to fluorescent at 8,000 hours and to incandescent at 1,200 hour average life. 

 LED lights are very consistent as they don't flicker; start instantly, and are not affected by temperature like florescent lights. They don't create any UV or IR radiation, and operate in a wide range of temperatures (-25°F to 140°F / -32°C to 60°C). 

 These lights are cool to the touch although if you hold your hand close to the light you will feel the heat of the light on your hand. The heat is from the light itself and if you then touch the light fixture, it is cool to the touch because of the low power consumption of the LEDs. Similar florescent lights feel warm to the touch as they typically produce 50% more heat for a given amount of light produced. 

 For general lighting we recommend the bright white ~4500k color range with frosted lens, however these lights come in warm white ~3000k which is slightly yellow like incandescent lights, bright white ~4500k which looks pure white, and daylight ~6500k which is slightly blue and can be a bit harsh. Lens also comes in clear which is more efficient but a bit harsh if directly viewed, so frosted lenses are more common as they defuse light for a more natural look."

They can be installed permanently or temporarily as they are completely self contained light fixtures that operate on 110v or 220v circuits. 

 The most outstanding traits of LED lighting its ability to operate using half the power of florescent lights and 1/7th the power of incandescent lights to create the same amount of light making these the most power saving and eco-friendly lights on the market. 

 The life of LED lighting is another great feature over florescent and incandescent lighting. LEDs have an increased average lifespan of 50,000+ hours compared to fluorescent at 8,000 hours and to incandescent at 1,200 hour average life. 

 LED lights are very consistent as they don't flicker; start instantly, and are not affected by temperature like florescent lights. They don't create any UV or IR radiation, and operate in a wide range of temperatures (-25°F to 140°F / -32°C to 60°C). 

 These lights are cool to the touch although if you hold your hand close to the light you will feel the heat of the light on your hand. The heat is from the light itself and if you then touch the light fixture, it is cool to the touch because of the low power consumption of the LEDs. Similar florescent lights feel warm to the touch as they typically produce 50% more heat for a given amount of light produced. 

 For general lighting we recommend the bright white ~4500k color range with frosted lens, however these lights come in warm white ~3000k which is slightly yellow like incandescent lights, bright white ~4500k which looks pure white, and daylight ~6500k which is slightly blue and can be a bit harsh. Lens also comes in clear which is more efficient but a bit harsh if directly viewed, so frosted lenses are more common as they defuse light for a more natural look."

They can be installed in any standard light socket, E26 or E27, as they are completely self contained lights that operate on 60hz 110v AC circuits. 

 The most outstanding traits of LED lighting its ability to operate using half the power of florescent lights and 1/7th the power of incandescent lights to create the same amount of light making these the most power saving and eco-friendly lights on the market. 

 The life of LED lighting is another great feature over florescent and incandescent lighting. LEDs have an increased average lifespan of 50,000+ hours compared to fluorescent at 8,000 hours and to incandescent at 1,200 hour average life. 

 LED lights are very consistent as they don't flicker; start instantly, and are not affected by temperature like florescent lights. They don't create any UV or IR radiation, and operate in a wide range of temperatures (-25°F to 140°F / -32°C to 60°C). 

 These lights are cool to the touch compared to traditional lights or CFL bulbs because of the lower power consumption of the LEDs. Similar florescent lights feel much warmer to the touch than LED lights as CFL or fluorescent lights typically produce 50% more heat for a given amount of light produced. 

 For general lighting we recommend the bright white ~4500K color range with frosted lens, however these lights come in warm white ~3000K which is slightly yellow like incandescent lights, bright white ~4500K which looks pure white, and daylight ~6500K which is slightly blue and can be a bit harsh. Lens also come in clear which is slightly more efficient but a bit harsh if directly viewed, so frosted lenses are more common as they defuse light for a more natural look."

 Equivalent to 25w Incandescent lighting.
 Works on 110v AC circuits in standard E26 / E27 light sockets.
 Great anywhere you use ordinary light bulbs, living & dining room, kitchen, garage, workshop, etc.","These are light weight, super bright, easy to handle (no glass), long lasting, and easy to install lights. They can be installed in any standard light socket, E26 or E27, as they are completely self contained lights that operate on 60hz 110v AC circuits. 

 The most outstanding traits of LED lighting its ability to operate using half the power of florescent lights and 1/7th the power of incandescent lights to create the same amount of light making these the most power saving and eco-friendly lights on the market. 

 The life of LED lighting is another great feature over florescent and incandescent lighting. LEDs have an increased average lifespan of 50,000+ hours compared to fluorescent at 8,000 hours and to incandescent at 1,200 hour average life. 

 LED lights are very consistent as they don't flicker; start instantly, and are not affected by temperature like florescent lights. They don't create any UV or IR radiation, and operate in a wide range of temperatures (-25°F to 140°F / -32°C to 60°C). 

 These lights are cool to the touch compared to traditional lights or CFL bulbs because of the lower power consumption of the LEDs. Similar florescent lights feel much warmer to the touch than LED lights as CFL or fluorescent lights typically produce 50% more heat for a given amount of light produced. 

 For general lighting we recommend the bright white ~4500K color range with frosted lens, however these lights come in warm white ~3000K which is slightly yellow like incandescent lights, bright white ~4500K which looks pure white, and daylight ~6500K which is slightly blue and can be a bit harsh. Lens also come in clear which is slightly more efficient but a bit harsh if directly viewed, so frosted lenses are more common as they defuse light for a more natural look."

They can be installed permanently or temporarily as they are completely self contained light fixtures that operate on 110v or 220v circuits. 

 The most outstanding traits of LED lighting its ability to operate using half the power of florescent lights and 1/7th the power of incandescent lights to create the same amount of light making these the most power saving and eco-friendly lights on the market. 

 The life of LED lighting is another great feature over florescent and incandescent lighting. LEDs have an increased average lifespan of 50,000+ hours compared to fluorescent at 8,000 hours and to incandescent at 1,200 hour average life. 

 LED lights are very consistent as they don't flicker; start instantly, and are not affected by temperature like florescent lights. They don't create any UV or IR radiation, and operate in a wide range of temperatures (-25°F to 140°F / -32°C to 60°C). 

 These lights are cool to the touch although if you hold your hand close to the light you will feel the heat of the light on your hand. The heat is from the light itself and if you then touch the light fixture, it is cool to the touch because of the low power consumption of the LEDs. Similar florescent lights feel warm to the touch as they typically produce 50% more heat for a given amount of light produced. 

 For general lighting we recommend the bright white ~4500k color range with frosted lens, however these lights come in warm white ~3000k which is slightly yellow like incandescent lights, bright white ~4500k which looks pure white, and daylight ~6500k which is slightly blue and can be a bit harsh. Lens also comes in clear which is more efficient but a bit harsh if directly viewed, so frosted lenses are more common as they defuse light for a more natural look."
